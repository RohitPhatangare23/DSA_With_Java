    Packages are containers for classes. They are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized.
    For example, a package allows you to create a class named List, which you can store in your own package without
    concern that it will collide with some other class named List stored elsewhere. Packages are stored in a hierarchical
    manner and are explicitly imported into new class definitions.
