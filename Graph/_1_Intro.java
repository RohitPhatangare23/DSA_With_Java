        -A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges
        -Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).
        Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes,can be labeled or unlabelled.
        Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. can be labeled or unlabelled

        Representation of Graphs =There are two ways to store a graph:
        Adjacency Matrix  = When the graph contains a large number of edges then it is good to store it as a matrix because only some entries in the matrix will be empty
        Adjacency List

        Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network.
        Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook etc.
